#Website Interface

The website interface is located in the `web/` directory. An example website interface can be viewed [here][1]


#Installation

1. Copy the contents of the `web/` directory into your `public_html` folder or your respective folder to serve website content
2. Rename the file `config.php.bak` to `config.php`
3. Edit `config.php` with the correct MySQL credentials to access the database

#Customize

The website interface was written in straight HTML. It is not hard to customize to your desired look.

To add your own custum header, simply drop it into the sample folder as `index.html` and rename it to `header.png`.

Any further customizations should not be too difficult to achieve. If you are having difficulty with customizations, please contact me. If I am not busy, I may be able to help you out.
